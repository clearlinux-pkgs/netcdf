The Unidata network Common Data Form (netCDF) is an interface for scientific data access
and a freely-distributed software library that provides an implementation of the interface.
The netCDF library also defines a machine-independent format for representing scientific data.
Together, the interface, library, and format support the creation, access, and sharing of
scientific data. The current netCDF software provides C interfaces for applications and data.
